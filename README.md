Summary: 
This project is a web application that recommends suitable drugs based on a user's symptoms. The system leverages a machine learning model trained on medical data to provide accurate and reliable suggestions.


How to use:
- Open the website and enter symptoms faced by patient via the dropbox.
- Click "Predict" to get the recommended drug.
- Review the suggested drugs and read additional information.


Features:
- User-friendly Interface: A dropbox is used in order to input data.
- Accurate Drug Prediction: Machine learning model predicts appropriate drugs.
- Displays detailed drug information and possible side effects.
- Allows feedback for improving model accuracy.
- NMC Verification: We use Indian Medical Registry Search so that only certified Doctors could use our tools.


Future Add Ons:
1. Provide feedback option to take user feedback and improve model.
2. Give Drug side effects.
3. Give a list of possible diseases.
4. Give Recommended Dossage
